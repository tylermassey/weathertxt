###What it is
Weather Txt is a web service that will send daily weather forecast text messages. Users can sign up by providing a phone number, zipcode, and a time of day that they want to receive the forecast. I made this to practice with web development.

###What it is built on
- A Django backend
- TextBelt for sending SMS
- Celery for scheduling

###To do next
- change the quick fix regex code
- cleanup

###Down the road
- change out the sms service
- implement 2 way communication
